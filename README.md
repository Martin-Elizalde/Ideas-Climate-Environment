# Ideas-Climate-and-Environment

Thanks for stopping by!

This repository explores rough concepts and ideas to implement Machine Learning for industries and topics like: Environment, Climate and Natural Resources Management.

The tools of Machine Learning are used widely today outside of academia in different fields, mainly related to Big Tech companies. However I see a lot of potential in my line of work as professional in the fields of environment and climate. 

While Machine-learning research is growing in my field, it is still not a common tool in everyday practice. My hope with this repository is to explore and promote some ideas on the potential of Machine Learning in this field and invite others to contribute. 

For more on my thoughts of the relationship of Machine-learning and the Environemnt please check out my article https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/machine-learning-natural-resources-management-can-we-martin/?trackingId=JskF2k1BTnylw7gvcsOI8g%3D%3D
